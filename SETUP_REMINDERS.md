## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Team meeting Room 5" vs "Meeting"
2. **Add Buffer Time**: Remind yourself 5-10 min before deadlines
3. **Use Action Words**: "Call", "Check", "Submit", "Review"
4. **Check Regularly**: Use `/reminders` to see what's coming up

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Personal Only**: Only you see your reminders
- **Channel Specific**: Delivered where you set them
- **Time Limits**: 10 seconds minimum, 7 days maximum
- **Memory Based**: Reminders reset if bot restarts (temporary limitation)
